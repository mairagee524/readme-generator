## Installation

To install necessary dependencies, run the following command: 

```
npm install
```

After typing `npm install` the developer will then type `node index.js` to start the CLI application. The CLI application will have a series of questions that the user will have to answer.


## Usage

A developer may use this application after completing his/her/their code. Or it can be done before, so that the developer can be better organized when writing code. Of course, it can be modified during the process.
